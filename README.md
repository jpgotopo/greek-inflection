# greek-inflection

Python library for generating (and analyzing) Ancient Greek inflectional paradigms


## History

Version 1 of this work was developed in January 2014 in Esperance, Western
Australia.

Version 2 was a fresh-start, drawing on lessons learned in Version 1, and was
developed from November 2014 (at the SBL Annual Meeting in San Diego) until
February 2015 (mostly in Perth, Western Australia).

Version 3 (what you see in this repo) was yet another fresh-start but has now
well and truly surpassed the capabilities of previous versions and is likely to
be the foundation for work to come in the foreseeable future.
